We think that the target user group for this kind of device are students living alone or small
homes where you have a few plants to help you take care of your plants. 

What we have now is one device (Sensor) connected to one “brain” (Pi), but we know that you can get wireless
sensors, which would allow us to connect several devices to one brain. There are also options for
cheaper pi’es if you can’t get wireless devices. What we are trying to say is that you have a few
options for setting this up to suit your needs. By following the set up guide step by step that we have
provided. Everyone should be able to set this up even with no or minimal coding experience.

We would also like to add that it is quite possible to incorporate this with other projects. For example
you could have pi mirror project and have a continuous “stream”/ update of the sensors. Marking
them red for example if the plant needs water. A system like that could be as follows: green numbers = good
status. Orange = needs water soon and red is critical status, it needs water asap. Just to name another use for this hardware/project.

Further development of the project would be to contact some botanists to discuss further progress.
Some examples could be, plant species and water level for each type of plant. We could also get some
light sensors or light sources to make the ideal environment for the plants, there is a lot that can be
done. Only you limit yourself.
