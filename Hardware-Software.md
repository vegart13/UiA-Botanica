Hardware used in the project:      
[Raspberry Pi 3B](https://www.power.no/datakomponenter/hovedkort/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/p-875483/)      
[Humidity Sensor      
Analog to digital signal converter](https://www.ebay.com/itm/New-16pcs-Sensor-Module-Board-Kit-for-Arduino-Raspberry-Pi-3-B-2-Model-B/382512267088?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649)     
5 kabler      

Software      
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)      
[Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)      
[Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (To program outside the raspberry)      


To install the software needed for our program to run just follow the instructions in the links above.
When buying our sensors we bought a bag with several and therefore we don’t exactly know the model number of our humidity sensor and analog converter but from what we have seen any other model should work just fine as they are all very similar if not equal to each other.
If you buy or have a different Raspberry Pi model you have to find the correct pins to take in input and change the GPIO.IN variable in the python script, as you will see in the setup guide.
