For smtp to work with your mail certain configurations need to be made to your email. Here is a guide to how you enable
it in gmail. 

You first have to navigate to the settings tab shown in the first screenshot link below at step 1. After settings is opened
there are tabs at the top of the main window. Click on the "FORWARDING AND POP/IMAP" tab.

Once you have opened the "FORWARDING AND POP/IMAP" tab you need to find the "enable IMAP" setting. See the screenshot below if
you have difficulties finding it. Once it's enabled your mail is set up for smtp.
