To help get you started with the setup of your very own humidity sensor to keep your plants alive longer, we have made a guide for you to follow to keep things simple.

Just follow these steps and we should get you up and running in no time.

1. Step one is to download raspbian. Any version of raspbian will work, but we reccomend either "Raspbian Stretch with desktop and recommended software" or "Raspbian Stretch with desktop". Having a desktop will help out a lot if you are new to this.
After downloading raspbian and following the how to steps from their SITE and you have raspbian installed on your sd card move on to step 2. 
2. Step 2 is Optional. If you prefer to do everything on your desktop or laptop before moving on to the pi, you will need a python editior. This is to edit the neccesary parts in the code to get email notifications. We reccomend Pycharm. A link can be found in our software reccomendations tab.
3. Step 3. Create a gmail account. We will need a gmail account to send us notifications. A seperate guide that we have made will take you through a few simple steps to get you sortet. (You will need a throwaway gmail account for this setup to work.) 
4. Now you should download our code from github found under the software tab.
5. Open our code either on your computer (requieres python editor like pycharm) or open directly on your pi.
6. Follow the instructions inside the code and edit the correct parts to match your gmail and any other options to fit your prefrences.
7. Run the code, and test the hardware with a glass of water. If you get an email you are correctly set up.
8. Now install the hardware where you plan to use it and keep your plant alive!
